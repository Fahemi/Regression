# Regression
Regression Analysis can be performed on a variety of software today. The ubiquitous Microsoft Excel is still by far the most popular tool. A variety of other free and paid tools are available to run regression analysis. Some of these include SPSS, SAS, R, Python and JMP, etc. Each of these tools presents the regression analysis output data in different ways. However, all of these tools provide essentially the same data. We present the regression output from some of the tools mentioned above.  Regression analysis is a predictive modelling technique. Linear regression is one of the simplest and most common supervised machine learning algorithms that data scientists use for predictive modelling. In this report, Iâ€™ll use linear regression to build a model that predicts the results of pitch carbon analysis tests. The determination of explicit form of regression equation is the ultimate objective of regression analysis. It is finally a good and valid relationship between study variable and explanatory variables. Such regression equation can be used for several purposes. For example, to determine the role of any explanatory variable in the joint relationship in any policy formulation, to forecast the values of response variable for given set of values of explanatory variables. The regression equation helps is understanding the interrelationships of variables among them.
